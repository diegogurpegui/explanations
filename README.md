# Explanations

Do you want to explain a concept like Bitcoin, Blockchain, or any other to someone and only have a few characters or just a few seconds/minutes?

Well you can come here and just copy and paste it!.. or be inspired by it.

And more importantly, if you already handle yourself around the subject... please contribute! This is supposed to be a 100% collaborative project.

## How does his work?

For each concept here you'll find different aspects to explain, like its *definition*, *how it works*, etc. And on each document you'll see all of those explanations grouped by the maximum amount of words, that way you will be able to choose the one that suits you the most.

You will also see that, for some cases, there is more than one alternative.

In the future, the content might be re-structured and a web interface can be created to read from that in order to provide better UX.
